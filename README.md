# CNN-for-Brain-Tumor
This is a simple Convolutional Neural Network Model for Brain Tumor Classification into four tumor types and one control group.


# Requirements
1. Python 2.7.x or Python 3.5.x or larger
2. Tensorflow v1.0+ and Tensorflow GPU version to run on a graphic card
3. Scikit learn libraries
4. Numpy and Scipy
5. TFLearn (http://tflearn.org/installation/)

Installation of Tensorflow and other libraries can be found in their websites.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this research project is available under the link https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qor3axvczfd02xy/AABtBMWs8s-_BkIFquOC5Pbua?dl=0

# Execution
1. Make sure all the libaries are installed

2. Get the dataset in the same folder as the program

3. Run the proposed model 
```
 $ python proposed_model.py
 ```
 
 # Altering the program
 You can use the proposed model, change the parameters in it to test for yourown dataset.
